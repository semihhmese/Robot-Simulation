# 6-Axis-Simulation

This project simulates a 6-axis robot arm created using the Three.js library. The code includes comments and controls, providing an interface to rotate each joint of the robot arm.

## How to Use

1. Clone the project to your computer or download it as a ZIP:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/semihhmese/Robot-Simulation.git
    ```

    or download the ZIP file [here](https://github.com/semihhmese/Robot-Simulation/archive/main.zip).

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to observe the simulation of the robot arm.

## Controls

The project provides a control interface using the [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) library. The controls visible in the browser include:

- **Base:** Rotate the base between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Shoulder:** Rotate the shoulder between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Joint 2:** Rotate the 2nd joint between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Joint 3:** Rotate the 3rd joint between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Joint 4:** Rotate the 4th joint between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Joint 5:** Rotate the 5th joint between 0 and 180 degrees.
- **Gripper:** Rotate the gripper between 0 and 180 degrees.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui): A JavaScript library for creating a control interface.
